## Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Django**: A Python web framework for building robust and scalable RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database system used to store and manage the project’s data efficiently.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and flexibility.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A state management library used to manage and centralize the application’s state.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code, used here for supporting backend services.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform that ensures consistent development and deployment environments.
- **AWS**: Cloud services used for hosting, storage, and deployment of the application.
## Database Design

The project requires the following key entities:

### 1. Users
- **Fields**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`  
- **Description**: Represents individuals using the platform. Users can be property owners or guests.
- **Relationships**: 
  - A user can own multiple properties.
  - A user can make multiple bookings.
  - A user can leave multiple reviews.

### 2. Properties
- **Fields**: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`  
- **Description**: Represents properties listed on the platform.
- **Relationships**: 
  - A property belongs to one user (owner).
  - A property can have multiple bookings.
  - A property can have multiple reviews.

### 3. Bookings
- **Fields**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`  
- **Description**: Represents reservations made by users for properties.
- **Relationships**: 
  - A booking belongs to one user.

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Users can have roles such as guests or property owners, which determine their access and actions within the platform.

### 2. Property Management
Property owners can list, edit, and remove properties on the platform. Each property includes details like title, description, location, price, and availability, helping users find suitable accommodations.

### 3. Booking System
Users can search for available properties and make bookings for specific dates. The system ensures bookings are tracked, prevents double bookings, and calculates the total price automatically.

### 4. Reviews and Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature promotes transparency and helps other users make informed decisions based on past experiences.

### 5. Payment Processing
The platform handles payments for bookings, including tracking payment status and storing transaction information securely. This ensures a smooth and trustworthy financial experience for both guests and hosts.

### 6. Search and Filter
Users can search for properties using criteria such as location, price, and availability. Advanced filtering options enhance the user experience by helping them find the most relevant listings quickly.
## API Security

Securing backend APIs is critical to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of the platform. The following key security measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication**  
  Users must log in to access protected resources. Authentication ensures that only registered users can interact with the system, protecting sensitive information like personal details and payment data.

- **Authorization**  
  Different user roles (guest, host, admin) will have controlled access to resources. Authorization prevents users from performing actions they are not permitted to, such as editing someone else's property listing.

- **Rate Limiting**  
  The system will limit the number of API requests from a single user or IP in a given time frame. This helps prevent abuse, such as brute-force attacks or denial-of-service attempts.

- **Data Validation and Sanitization**  
  Input data from users will be validated and sanitized to prevent malicious inputs, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS), ensuring the safety of both the database and frontend.

- **Secure Payment Handling**  
  Payment-related APIs will follow best practices, including HTTPS encryption and integration with secure payment gateways. This protects users’ financial data during transactions.
## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying applications. CI/CD ensures that code changes are integrated frequently, tested automatically, and deployed reliably, reducing errors and speeding up development.

For this project, the CI/CD pipeline will help maintain code quality, automate testing for features like booking and payment processing, and ensure that updates are safely deployed to production.

**Tools that can be used:**
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows such as running tests and deploying updates.
- **Docker**: Provides consistent containerized environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Postman / Newman**: For automated API testing as part of the pipeline.
- **Heroku / AWS**: For automated deployment of the backend and frontend services.
